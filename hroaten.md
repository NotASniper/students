I am a Junior CS major at utk, I have worked at an offroading tour business for several summers and noted a need for some kind of catalog system documenting when vehicles
are used, damaged, or receive maintenance. I would like to create a database or catlog that demsontrates how useful such a system would be at HCUTV
