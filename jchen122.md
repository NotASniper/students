My name is Jeffrey Chen. I don't have any particular interests and I'm kind of hoping this class will at least give me the insight into a field I would be interested in. So I am open to everything. The only idea that I think is kinda useful to me would be making an upgraded version of siri by comining an AI model with siri; essentially kind of making a google home without needing to buy a google home or an Alexa. I would like to add that my previous interests before was mobile development but it was very tedious and such. I semi desire to dabble in other fields to see if there is a field that is best suited for me.
