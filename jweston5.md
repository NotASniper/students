My name is Jonah Weston, and I am a senior double majoring in honors computer science and honors mathematics. I am currently 18, but I will be spending 6 years in UG graduating with 2 bachelor's degrees when I am 21. I am interested in anything related to systems programming, frameworks and libraries, numerical analysis, mathematics, cybersecurity, or backend in general, but I would be most happy learning something new and practical.
