My name is Mylon Jones. I am currently interested in embedded software and software/hardware interfaces. I had a co-op internship over the last 9 months and I worked with many electrical engineers and wrote code for one of their boards.

For the team project, I want to use image recognition or some other machine learning technology. I am seriously considering using the body farm data to create a tool that might be useful for the anthropology department. Something that could make some guesses or estimations about a person based on a picture of their skull. For example, maybe try to generate an image of what that person's face might have looked like.

I would also be interested in doing a project using hardware like a microcontroller or robotic device of some kind. Perhaps a device that will take a picture of an analog clock and then display a digital translation on a screen or it could audibly tell you the time.
