I am Ryan Trenner, I'm a junior with intern experenice with the US Air Force.
I am intersted in cybersecurity and machine learning, possibly using the two together.
One project I'd like to take on this semester is a facial reconigiton app, that could help 
in tracking lost people, or criminals on the run.
