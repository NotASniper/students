Hi! I am Shipra Patel, a junior-year Computer Science student.I am interested in learning different things in CS exploring various opportunity in technology, while discovering where I belong – I am in the process of finding my strengths and would want to leverage and grow on them. Tech has many dimensions (which helps me enhance logical and analytical skills), and I don’t believe just through academic exposure you can learn all.
